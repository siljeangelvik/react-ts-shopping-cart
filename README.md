### Goal
To apply knowledge of React to build an eCom store.

### Brief
The API you are using for this brief is:   
https://api.noroff.dev/api/v1/online-shop

You can find individual items by appending a product ID at the end of the API URL e.g.   
https://api.noroff.dev/api/v1/online-shop/f99cafd2-bd40-4694-8b33-a6052f36b435

You are tasked with build out the following pages for an eCom store:
* Homepage 
* Individual product page 
* Cart page 
* Checkout success page

~~The Homepage should have a list of all the products.   
There should be a look-ahead search bar that filters products when typing in a product name.   
Clicking on a product should take a user to an individual product page.~~

~~Your pages should use a <Layout> component that contains a header and footer.   
The header should contain a nav bar as well as a Cart icon component that   
acts as a button as well as displays the current number of items in the cart.~~

~~The individual product page should display data for a single product.~~   
~~There should be an `Add to cart` button which, upon clicking, adds the product to the cart.~~   
~~The product page should display the title of the product, the description and the image.~~   
~~There should also be reviews listed for the product, if there are any.~~   

~~You should use the `discountedPrice` property to display the price of the product.~~   
~~If there is a difference between the `discountedPrice` and `price` properties then that means   
there is a discount for that product. Calculate what this discount is and display it on the page.~~

~~Clicking on the Cart icon will load the Cart page,   
which will list all of the products as well as a total.~~   
~~The Cart page will have a Checkout button.~~   
~~Clicking this Checkout button then goes to a Checkout success page.~~

~~The Checkout success page will display a message to the user notifying them that their order was successful.~~   
~~There should also be a link that lets a user go back to the store.~~   
~~The cart must be cleared if the user gets to the Checkout success page.~~

~~There will be a contact page which will   
contain a contact form with the following fields.   
There must be form validation:~~
* Full name (Minimum number of characters is 3, required)  
* Subject (Minimum number of characters is 3, required)
* Email (Must be a valid email address, required)
* Body (Minimum number of characters is 3, required)

~~You will be using React Router to switch between pages.~~

~~Your design should be responsive. You are welcome to use a CSS Framework, however,   
youâ€™re encouraged to design from scratch and use styled-components or CSS Modules.~~

You are not required to use TypeScript.

~~Your code is expected to be clean and well-formatted.~~

### Process
~~Create a new CRA app.~~

~~Create a Header that has a Nav.~~ 

~~Create a Cart Icon component and position this next to your Nav. This Cart Icon component will have an overlay that displays the number of items in the cart.~~ 

~~Create a Footer component.~~ 

~~Create a Layout component that has your Header and Footer.~~
 

Create the other pages:
 
6.1 ~~ContactPage~~  
6.2 ~~ProductPage~~  
6.3 ~~CheckoutPage~~  
6.4 ~~CheckoutSuccessPage~~  
 
~~Add React Router and route to each of the pages.~~    
The ProductPage page will be using a dynamic segment.   
~~Fetch the list of products on the Homepage and store this as a state.~~   
~~On the homepage, loop through the products and display a Product component for each of the values.~~   
~~This Product component should look like a product card.~~   
~~Each Product component will have a View product button which will link to the ProductPage page.~~ 

The homepage should have a lookahead/auto-complete Search bar component.   
~~Typing values in the search bar should display products where the title matches the search input.~~   
~~Clicking on an item should take the user to the ProductPage page.~~   
~~Tip: Filter the user input and then display products that match the input.~~ 

~~On the ProductPage, use the ID of the product as the params for the dynamic segment.~~   
~~Add the product details as mentioned in the brief.~~ 
~~Create a cart state.~~   
~~When the Add to cart button on the ProductPage is clicked, add the product to the cart.~~ 
~~Clicking on the Cart Icon component will take the user to the CheckoutPage page.~~ 

~~The CheckoutPage must list all of the products in the cart, show a total at the bottom and a Checkout button.~~ 
~~Clicking the Checkout button will take the user to the CheckoutSuccessPage.~~ 

~~The CheckoutSuccessPage should display that the order was successful and clear the cart.~~   
~~There should be a link to go back to the store.~~
 
~~On the ContactPage, create the following inputs with the following requirements.~~
 
16.1 ~~Full name (Minimum number of characters is 3, required)~~  
16.2 ~~Subject (Minimum number of characters is 3, required)~~  
16.3 ~~Email (Must be a valid email address, required)~~  
16.4 ~~Body (Minimum number of characters is 3, required)~~  
16.5 ~~Submit button~~   
~~console.log the data from the form once validation requirements are met.~~ 

Once your project is done, deploy it to Netlify.
